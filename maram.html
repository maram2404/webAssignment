            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at University of Jeddah, College of Computing and Information Technology, starting in 2022 and expected to graduate around mid-2025. I chose this major due to the critical need for secure digital systems in todayâ€™s world.

My studies have included essential courses in<b> C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, data science, and software development</b>. These courses have enhanced my technical skills and fostered a strong foundation in logical and analytical thinking, which is crucial for addressing cybersecurity challenges.

I have received Academic Excellence Certificates each year, highlighting my dedication to my education. Additionally, I have participated in various free online courses related to cybersecurity, further enriching my knowledge.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue professional certifications, such as <i>Certified Ethical Hacker </i>(CEH) and <i>CompTIA Security+</i>, to deepen my expertise and prepare for a successful career in the cybersecurity field.

my educational journey at Jeddah University has been rewarding, equipping me with the skills and knowledge necessary to contribute to the future of digital security.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <div class="projects">
                <h3><i>Cruies Booking Systems</i></h3>
                <p>During my studies, I collaborated with my sister on a Cruise Booking System projects for our Java courses. The system has two versions:project Version 1, a basic system with window dialogs, and project Version 2, an enhanced system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The first version allowed customers to search for cruises, select cabins, and make bookings, while administrators could manage bookings and customer data. The second version improved user experience with features like enhanced navigation, detailed cruise information, and a secure booking process. Developing these projects taught me valuable skills in Java programming, backend development, user interface design, and handling real-world tasks such as booking and scheduling. The window dialogs in the first version helped me understand user interaction, while the GUI in the second version enhanced the overall user experience.Please give it a try.</p>
